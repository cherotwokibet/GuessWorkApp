# GuessWorkApp

GuessWorkApp is a simple game written in a JavaScript. The program allows a
user to select a number and gauge the computer guesses whether its lower(-) 
or greater(+) than the user's selected number until the computer guesses 
the real user's selected number. It also keeps the records of the number of
guesses.

Look at you trying to be smarter than the computer hahaha...
